# Smart-Predictive-Modeling-for-Rental-Property-Prices

## In the real estate industry, determining the appropriate rental price for a property is crucial for property owners, tenants, and property management companies. Accurate rent predictions can help landlords set competitive prices, tenants make informed rental decisions, and property management companies optimize their portfolio management.

## 1.] Importing Necessary Packages
### The project begins by importing essential Python packages for data analysis and visualization, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and warnings.

## 2.]Importing Dataset
### The dataset, comprising training and test data, is imported for analysis and modeling. Initial exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the structure and features of the dataset.

## 3.]Data Preprocessing
### Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, converting data types, and addressing outliers to prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.

## 4.]Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### EDA is conducted to gain insights into the relationships between various features and the target variable (rental price). Visualizations such as pair plots, bar plots, and correlation matrices help in understanding the data distribution and identifying patterns.

## 5.]Feature Selection and Engineering
### Key features influencing rental prices are selected based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge. Feature engineering techniques are applied to create new informative features.

## 6.]Model Selection, Training, and Evaluation
### Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor models are selected for predicting rental prices. The models are trained on the training dataset and evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).

## 7.]Hyperparameter Tuning
### Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest Regressor model's performance. The best parameters and model are selected based on cross-validated performance metrics.

## Summary
### The results and evaluation metrics indicate that the Random Forest Regressor model outperformed other models in predicting rental prices on both training and test datasets. The project concludes with insights into the predictive modeling process for rental property prices and the importance of accurate rent predictions in the real estate market.
